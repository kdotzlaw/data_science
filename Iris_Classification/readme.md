# Iris Flower Classification

Determines the best machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into the correct species (setosa, versicolor, virginica) based on its characteristics (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width).

This project uses numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, and sklearn for metrics, preprocessing, and machine learning models.

## Descriptive Statistics

For each column in the dataset, determine:
- The number of missing values
- The percentage of missing values
- Statistics: Mean, Median, Mode, Standard Deviation, Min, Max, Quartiles

### Sepal Length

There are no missing values in SepalLengthCm, meaning the percentage of missing values is 0%.
The minimum SepalLengthCm is 4.3 while the maximum SepalLengthCm is 7.9. The mean, median and mode were found to be 5.843333333333334, 5.8, and 0    5.0 respectively. The standard deviation of SepalLengthCm is 0.828066127977863. The data spread of SepalLengthCm is outlined in the quartile table below.

| Quartile | SepalLengthCm |
|-|-|
| 0.25| 5.1 |
| 0.50| 5.8 |
| 0.75| 6.4 |

### Sepal Width
There are no missing values in SepalWidthCm, meaning the percentage of missing values is 0%.
The minimum SepalLengthCm is 4.3 while the maximum SepalLengthCm is 7.9. The mean, median and mode were found to be 5.843333333333334, 5.8, and 0    5.0 respectively. The standard deviation of SepalLengthCm is 0.828066127977863. The data spread of SepalLengthCm is outlined in the quartile table below.

| Quartile | SepalLengthCm |
|-|-|
| 0.25| 5.1 |
| 0.50| 5.8 |
| 0.75| 6.4 |
